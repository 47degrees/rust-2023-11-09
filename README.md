Rust: An Introduction
---------------------

An introductory presentation of the Rust programming language, primarily focused
on fostering internal interest and engagement. The focus of the Rust is memory
safety, arguably its most distinctive, novel, and powerful feature.

The presentation is made with [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/), and is located
in [docs](/docs). The original script on which the presentation
is based is [here](/docs/doc/Rust%20Talk%202023.11.09.docx), in
Microsoft Word format. I may adapt it for Markdown if I have some spare cycles.

The other top-level directories correspond to the various functional and
(intentionally) nonfunctional code samples used as props for the presentation.
